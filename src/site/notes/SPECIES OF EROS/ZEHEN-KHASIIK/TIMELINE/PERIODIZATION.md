> **PERIODIZATION OF THE ZEHEN-KHASIIK**

Kariians have numerous ways of defining their periods of history, however the 'dominant' time period is the current era, with the secondary being the period in which resets with each induction of a new Speaker of the Dominion.

# DOMINANT CYCLES:
- AGE OF EMERGENCE - The Kariians discover how to access the space beyond their own system, and discover the hyperlane network of Eros.
- AGE OF DISCOVERY - Three centuries pass of mapping out and discovering the systems in the left arm of the Eros Galaxy. The alliances between the clans is tenuous at best.
- AGE OF ANGUISH - ['The Ravaging'](obsidian://open?vault=EROS%20GALAXY&file=SPECIES%20OF%20EROS%2FZEHEN-KHASIIK%2FTIMELINE%2FHISTORICAL%20EVENTS%2FTHE%20RAVAGING) takes place; a devastating attack on the home-system transforms Kariio into a deadly radioactive wasteland. Only through the efforts of early biological engineering and the proper technology for protection is the hostile world survivable.
- AGE OF REPRISAL - War-Leader Rosysak azet Wohorok rallies the Great Clans together to officially form a single species-spanning government — The Kariian Dominion. A new age of prosperity immediately follows after the First Xeno War - it is often looked back upon as one of the greatest periods of Kariian history.
- AGE OF SUPREMACY - tba
- AGE OF FELLOWSHIP - The Council is formed; an oligarchy of Kariians composed from the Great Clans of Kariio 15-R, effectively giving representation and more power to the people (or rather, the clans) as opposed to the Speaker being the sole representation.
- AGE OF GENESIS - An incredibly intelligent and renowned biologist named Isthiv va Kyoya creates the Ra Sævekhi (also known as Rava), a bio-engineered mutualistic parasite that renders its host immortal. 
- AGE OF FORBEARANCE - Also commonly known derisively as the Age of Mercy due to the current Speaker Xaekath's penchant for taking pity on their defeated enemies, and offering them peaceful integration into the Dominion.
- AGE OF STRIFE – TBA
- AGE OF INTRIGUE – TBA
- AGE OF STAGNANCE – A long period of economic depression, as well as a fairly unremarkably uneventful time.
- AGE OF TENACITY –
