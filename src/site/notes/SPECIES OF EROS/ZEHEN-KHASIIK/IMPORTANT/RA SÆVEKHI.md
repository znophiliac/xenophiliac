# THE RA SÆVEKHI

The Ra Sævekhi, also called ***Rava*** for short, are bioengineered microparasites initially created by the prolific Kariian, Kyoya the Immortal. The title of Immortal was coined due to the Rava's most important trait: *the ability to halt the process of aging*, making oneself immune to the ravages of time, *making oneself immortal*.They spread throughout the entire body, until they possess every vein and every organ. While dubbed **parasites**, it would be more accurate to call their relationship with their hosts, the Kariians, as mutualistic. In exchange for this immortality as well as a myriad of other defensive mechanisms, the Ra Sævekhi greatly degrades one's fertility, making reproducing extremely difficult without issue. This is the main factor in the full-blooded Kariians' low population.

`ALONGSIDE IMMORTALITY:`
-   It can 'freeze' the body and turn the blood to a substance akin to antifreeze; this allows the Kariians the ability to endure drastically colder weather, and to more intense levels, to put one's own body into a state of cryostasis
-   It nullifies the vast majority of slow-acting poisons/toxins/diseases, as Rava will also act as a hyper-engineered immune system as well; only extremely quickly acting substances will impact a Kariian
