# NAMING CONVENTIONS

While not every Kariian followed the same name structure in the distant past, they have long since agreed upon *a single definitive name-structure* for ease of streamlining much of their society. In addition to individual identification, a Kariian’s name will also describe a Kariian’s clan, world (or station) of birth, and which Kariian gave birth to them (which may not be who the Kariian’s caretakers are). Some Kariians will forgo certain parts of a name, such as their progenitor in the instance of a tense relationship, but this is often met with side-eyes and suspicion from others of their own kind.

Even the core name, the **two names** that are exclusive to an individual, is intended as a descriptor; a Kariian will be named after their attributes, physical or mental. The ***first name*** is given sometime after birth, when the *parent* knows their cub well enough to give them an appropriate name. The ***second name*** is given when a young adult has ‘proven’ themselves, then upon their *superior* (who may be a military officer, a prestigous scientist, the clan dominant) will choose one for them. Names that may be perceived as neutral, or perceived as either positive or negative depending on circumstance, are most common. Solely derogatory names are rare, though still exist.
