## THE GALAXY OF LIFE

Whether all alien life in Eros actually *originates* within the galaxy itself is up for debate, as stories of inter-galactic travelers have been well documented. Regardless of what the truth is or not, life in this galaxy is unique from each other, with very few sharing common ancestors. Multi-species hybrids are also very common, leading to a diverse array of subraces of every kind.

Aliens that come from the Plaguelands are *very* rarely seen outside The Silent Dominion, with the Kariians themselves being the most enigmatic and scarce of them all, rivaling the solitary Vhrosevphaels from the Tsuris Mosaic.

## BRIEF DESCRIPTORS OF EACH SPECIES

> THE SILENT DOMINION

- **ZEHEN-KHASIIK** : *The demons of Eros,* the Kariians are highly reviled and feared. Remarkably little is known about them outside of the Plaguelands because all who encounter them disappear, and their technology overwhelms and disables others, leaving most info to rely solely on word of mouth… And given almost everyone who sees them goes missing (and is presumed dead), this is also unlikely.
